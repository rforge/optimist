  INSTALLATION

    o `matlab4r' will be a pure R package without using any source code.
      Therefore, installation will be immediate on all platforms.

  INTENTION

    o This package provides R implementations of more advanced math
      functions from Matlab and Octave (and the Euler Math Toolbox)
      with a special view on optimization and time series routines.
