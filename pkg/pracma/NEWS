------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.2-2

  NEW FUNCTIONS

    o vnorm() vector norm

  CORRECTIONS

    o Warning about a nasty "non-ASCII input" in the savgol.RD file
      has been resolved.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.2-1

  NEW FUNCTIONS

    o horner() implementing the horner scheme for evaluating a polynomial
      and its derivative.

    o savgol() Savitzki-Golay smoothing and needed pseudoinverse pinv().

RESTARTED AS VERSION 0.2-0

  NAME CHANGE

    o Package renamed to 'pracma' to avoid name clashes with packages
      such as 'matlab' that are sticking closer to the original.

  OTHER CHANGES

    o Added 'pracma-package' section to the manual.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1-9

  NEW FUNCTIONS

    o reshape(), repmat(), and blkdiag() matrix functions.

    o combs() chooses all combinations of k elements out of n, and
      randcomb() generates a random selection.

    o perms() generates all permutations, randperm() a random permutation.

    o Pascal triangle as pascal(); nchoosek() returns binomial coefficients.

    o Some string functions: strcmp(), strcmpi(), strcat().


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1-8

  NEW FUNCTIONS

    o std() as refinement of standard deviation function.

    o ceil() and fix() as aliases for ceiling() and trunc().
      [floor() and round() already exist in R.]

    o Modulo functions mod(), rem() and integer division idiv().

    o Integer functions related to the Euclidean algorithm:
      extgcd(), gcd(), lcm(), coprime(), and modinv().

    o distmat() and crossn(), the vector product in n-dimensional space.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1-7

  NEW FUNCTIONS

    o size(), numel(), ndims(), isempty(), and find().

    o eye(), ones(), zeros().

    o Functions returning random numbers: rand(), randn(), randi().

    o linspace(), logspace(), and logseq() for linearly, logarithmically,
      and exponentially spaced sequences.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1-6

  NEW FUNCTIONS

    o Matrix functions mdiag() and mtrace() added. inv() is introduced
      as an alias for solve() in R.

    o Generate special matrices hankel(), rosser(), and wilkinson().
      kron() is an alias for the R function kronecker().

  OTHER CHANGES

    o Renamed factors() to ifactor() to distiguish it more clearly from
      factors as used in R.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1-5

  NEW FUNCTIONS:

    o Added function for flipping or rotating numeric and complex
      matrices: flipdim(). flipud(), fliplr(), and rot90().

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1-4

  NEW FUNCTIONS:

    o Added basic complex functions real(), imag(), conj(), and angle()
      which are essentially only aliases of the R functions Re(), Im(), 
      or Conj().

      angle() returns the angle of a complex number in radians. The R
      function Mod() is here only available as abs().

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1-3

  NEW FUNCTIONS:

    o Added compan() function for the `companion' matrix; the eig() function
      is an alias for the R eigen()values function.

    o Added the polynomial functions poly(), polyder(), polyfit(),
      polyint(), and polyval().

    o roots() returns real and complex roots of polynomials.

  OTHER CHANGES

    o Simplified the trapz() function.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1-2

  NEW FUNCTIONS

    o Added functions from number theory: primes(), isprime() and factors().

      The corresponding function for factors() in Matlab/Octave is called
      factor(), but that name should not be shadowed in R!

    o Added the polyarea() and trapz() functions.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1-1

  NEW FUNCTIONS

    o Added some simple functions such as nthroot(), pow2(), and nextpow2().

    o dot() and cross() functions for scalar and vector product.

    o Generate matrices through vander() and hilb().

INITIAL VERSION 0.1-0

  INSTALLATION

    o `matlab4r' will be a pure R package without using any source code.
      Therefore, installation will be immediate on all platforms.

  INTENTION

    o This package provides R implementations of more advanced math
      functions from Matlab and Octave (and the Euler Math Toolbox)
      with a special view on optimization and time series routines.
